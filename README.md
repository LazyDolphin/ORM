# C# ORM

A class-library project that implements a simple, light-weight, object-relational-mapper in C#.

It started out as a research project to replace the need for the enourmously heavey Microsoft Entity Framework. This project allows querying a data source whether it's a database, or webservice (work-in-progress), and perform operations like select, insert, update, delete. It also maps the database table records into logical objects and IEnumerable lists.
